# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development
- `yarn start` - Start the Expo development server
- `yarn ios` - Run the app on iOS simulator
- `yarn android` - Run the app on Android emulator  
- `yarn web` - Run the app in web browser
- `yarn prebuild` - Generate native iOS and Android directories

### Testing
- `yarn test` - Run tests in watch mode (Jest with jest-expo preset)
- No existing tests in the codebase yet

### Production
- `yarn ota` - Deploy over-the-air updates via EAS Update to production branch

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technology Stack
- **React Native** with **Expo** SDK 53
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native) for styling
- **Expo Router v5** for file-based routing
- **Socket.io** for real-time WebSocket communication
- **tweetnacl** for end-to-end encryption

### Project Structure
```
sources/
├── app/              # Expo Router screens
├── auth/             # Authentication logic (QR code based)
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── sync/             # Real-time sync engine with encryption
└── utils/            # Utility functions
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Authentication Flow**: QR code-based authentication using expo-camera with challenge-response mechanism
2. **Data Synchronization**: WebSocket-based real-time sync with automatic reconnection and state management
3. **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption using tweetnacl for all sensitive data
4. **State Management**: React Context for auth state, custom reducer for sync state
5. **Platform-Specific Code**: Separate implementations for web vs native (e.g., ChatInput.tsx vs ChatInput.web.tsx)

### Development Guidelines

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation
- Use **yarn** instead of npm for package management
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./sources/*`
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled - ensure all code is properly typed
- Follow existing component patterns when creating new UI components
- Real-time sync operations are handled through SyncSocket and SyncSession classes

### Important Files

- `sources/sync/types.ts` - Core type definitions for the sync protocol
- `sources/sync/reducer.ts` - State management logic for sync operations
- `sources/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication state management
- `sources/app/_layout.tsx` - Root navigation structure
