## App Description / Full Description

Happy Coder is the secure mobile companion for Claude Code that lets you continue your AI coding sessions anywhere. Built by developers who needed to check on Claude's progress during coffee breaks, this app brings the full Claude Code experience to your phone with military-grade encryption.

**Key Features:**

• Continue Claude Code sessions seamlessly between desktop and mobile
• Push notifications for permission requests and task completion
• Access conversation history even when your terminal is offline
• End-to-end encryption - your code stays private
• Real-time streaming of Claude's responses
• Zero-knowledge architecture - we can't read your data

**How It Works:**
1. Install the happy-coder CLI on your computer
2. Scan a QR code to securely pair your devices
3. Use 'happy' instead of 'claude' to start encrypted sessions
4. Switch between desktop and mobile instantly

Perfect for developers who:
- Want to monitor long-running tasks on the go
- Need secure access to proprietary code discussions
- Value privacy and open-source transparency
- Work from coffee shops, trains, or anywhere

Happy Coder uses the same encryption as Signal (TweetNaCl) and is completely open source. Your encryption keys never leave your device, and all data is encrypted before transmission.

Built by Bay Area engineers who believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch. We needed a way to securely check on our AI coding assistant while away from our desks - so we built it and shared it with the community.

Your code. Your privacy. Your Claude Code companion.
