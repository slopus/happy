### 🍎 macOS Installation Note
Due to macOS Gatekeeper security, you may see a "damaged" app warning for unsigned builds. To bypass this:
```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute from the app
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Happy.app
```
Then the app will launch normally. This is required for all unsigned macOS applications downloaded from the internet.

## 🏠 Who We Are

We're engineers scattered across Bay Area coffee shops and hacker houses, constantly checking how Claude is progressing on our pet projects during lunch breaks. Happy Coder was born from the frustration of not being able to peek at Claude building our side hustles while we're away from our keyboards. We believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch and sharing with the community.
