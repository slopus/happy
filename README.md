# Happy Coder - End-to-End Encrypted Client for Claude Code

**The secure mobile client for Claude Code with military-grade encryption**

Happy Coder is a mobile client that connects to Claude Code with complete end-to-end encryption. Every message, every code snippet, every interaction is encrypted on your device before transmission, ensuring your code and conversations remain private.

## üì¶ Project Components

- **[happy-cli](https://github.com/slopus/happy-cli)** - Command-line interface for Claude Code
- **[happy-server](https://github.com/slopus/happy-server)** - Backend server for encrypted sync
- **happy-coder** - This mobile client (you are here)

## üîê Why Happy Coder?

üõ°Ô∏è **Your Code Stays Private** - End-to-end encryption ensures only you can read your conversations. Perfect for proprietary codebases and sensitive projects.

‚òÅÔ∏è **Encrypted Cloud Sync** - Your sessions are stored in the cloud but fully encrypted. The server sees only encrypted data, never your actual code.

üì± **Real-Time Mobile Access** - Continue Claude Code sessions seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Watch Claude think and respond in real-time.

üîë **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** - We use TweetNaCl (same as Signal) for military-grade encryption. Your keys never leave your device.

üì° **Works Offline** - Encrypted sessions cached locally. Access your conversation history even without internet.

## How It Works

1. **Pair with QR Code**: Scan a QR code from your Claude Code terminal to establish a secure connection
2. **Automatic Encryption**: Every message is encrypted with a unique key before transmission
3. **Secure Sync**: Your encrypted messages sync in real-time across all paired devices
4. **Local Storage**: Encrypted sessions are stored on-device for offline access

## Open Source Transparency

Happy Coder is completely open source. You can:
- Audit the encryption implementation
- Verify no data collection
- Contribute improvements
- Self-host your own server

## Technical Stack

- React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile
- TypeScript with strict mode
- TweetNaCl for cryptography
- WebSocket for real-time sync
- NativeWind for styling
