# Happy

Code on the go — control AI coding agents from your phone, browser, or terminal.

Free. Open source. Code anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g happy
```

> Migrated from the `happy-coder` package. Thanks to [@franciscop](https://github.com/franciscop) for donating the `happy` package name!

## Usage

### Claude Code (default)

```bash
happy
# or
happy claude
```

This will:
1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Display a QR code to connect from your mobile device or browser
3. Allow real-time session control — all communication is end-to-end encrypted
4. Start new sessions directly from your phone or web while your computer is online

### More agents

```
happy codex
happy gemini
happy openclaw

# or any ACP-compatible CLI
happy acp opencode
happy acp -- custom-agent --flag
```

## Daemon

The daemon is a background service that stays running on your machine. It lets you spawn and manage coding sessions remotely — from your phone or the web app — without needing an open terminal.

```bash
happy daemon start
happy daemon stop
happy daemon status
happy daemon list
```

The daemon starts automatically when you run `happy`, so you usually don't need to manage it manually.

## Authentication

```bash
happy auth login
happy auth logout
```

Happy uses cryptographic key pairs for authentication — your private key stays on your machine. All session data is end-to-end encrypted before leaving your device.

To connect third-party agent APIs:

```bash
happy connect gemini
happy connect claude
happy connect codex
happy connect status
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HAPPY_SERVER_URL` | Custom server URL (default: `https://api.cluster-fluster.com`) |
| `HAPPY_WEBAPP_URL` | Custom web app URL (default: `https://app.happy.engineering`) |
| `HAPPY_HOME_DIR` | Custom home directory for Happy data (default: `~/.happy`) |
| `HAPPY_DISABLE_CAFFEINATE` | Disable macOS sleep prevention |
| `HAPPY_EXPERIMENTAL` | Enable experimental features |

### Using Happy behind an HTTP proxy

If your machine needs an HTTP or HTTPS proxy to reach Happy's relay server, set standard proxy environment variables:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:5901
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:5901
```

Happy also supports `ALL_PROXY` and lowercase variants such as `https_proxy`, `http_proxy`, and `all_proxy`.

This applies to both daemon machine connections and active session connections. It is useful for remote servers, containers, SSH reverse tunnels, corporate networks, or restricted outbound networks.

### Sandbox (experimental)

Happy can run agents inside an OS-level sandbox to restrict file system and network access.

```bash
happy sandbox configure
happy sandbox status
happy sandbox disable
```

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slopus/happy
cd happy-cli
yarn install
yarn workspace happy cli --help
```
