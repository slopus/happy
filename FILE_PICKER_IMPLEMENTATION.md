# iOS File Picker Implementation for Happy

## Summary
Added native iOS file picker functionality to Happy mobile app, enabling users to upload files and images directly from their device to Claude Code conversations.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `FilePickerButton.tsx`
- Located at: `sources/components/FilePickerButton.tsx`
- Features:
  - Document picker for any file type
  - Image picker with photo library access
  - iOS action sheet for selection type
  - Base64 encoding for images
  - Proper permission handling

### 2. Modified: `AgentInput.tsx`
- Added `onFileSelected` prop to handle file selection
- Integrated `FilePickerButton` component
- Positioned button next to Git status badge

### 3. Modified: `[id].tsx` (Session View)
- Added `onFileSelected` handler
- Basic implementation sends file info as message
- TODO: Implement actual file upload to Claude Code backend

## Usage

1. Tap the attachment icon (ðŸ“Ž) in the input bar
2. Choose between:
   - **Photo Library**: Select images from device
   - **Files**: Browse and select any file type
3. File information is sent to the conversation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (MVP)
- Test on physical iOS device
- Handle file upload errors gracefully
- Add loading state during upload

### Future Enhancements
- Actual file upload to Claude Code backend
- Support for multiple file selection
- File preview before sending
- Drag & drop on iPad
- Camera capture option
- Document scanning

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd happy-daydreamer-fork
yarn install

# Run on iOS simulator
yarn ios

# Or on connected device
yarn ios:connected-device
```

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies Used (already in package.json)
- `expo-document-picker`: Universal file picker
- `expo-image-picker`: Optimized image selection
- `expo-file-system`: File operations

### Permissions Required
- Photo Library access (requested on first use)
- No special permissions needed for document picker

### Current Limitations
- File content not actually sent to Claude Code yet
- Single file selection only
- No file size validation
- No progress indicator for large files

## Integration with Daydreamer

This implementation provides the foundation for:
1. **Screenshot sharing**: Quick debugging with visual context
2. **Document analysis**: Upload PDFs, code files, logs
3. **Image-based queries**: "What's in this photo?"
4. **Field inspection photos**: Drone imagery, site photos

The file picker makes Happy a practical mobile development environment where you can:
- Share screenshots of errors
- Upload config files for review
- Add images to document issues
- Include visual context in conversations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] File picker opens on button tap
- [ ] Photo library permission request works
- [ ] Images upload with base64 encoding
- [ ] Documents upload with correct metadata
- [ ] Cancel action works properly
- [ ] Error handling for failed uploads
- [ ] File info appears in conversation
