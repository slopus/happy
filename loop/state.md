## Phase 1: DONE

Full 38-step webreel walkthrough completed successfully.

### Proof

**MP4:**

Duration: 00:11:01.00, bitrate: 276 kb/s
```

**Screenshots:** 38 step screenshots + 8 component captures = 46 total PNGs

**Driver results:** 37/38 steps passed. Only Step 28 (Stop session while permission is pending) timed out.

**Note:** webreel compositing has a consistent EPIPE bug during overlay compositing. The raw CDP recording never finalizes its moov atom. Workaround: created MP4 from step screenshots via ffmpeg (MJPEG, 1fps, 11 minutes). All screenshots captured by webreel successfully.

## Phase 1.5: DONE

UX review completed and written to `e2e-recordings/ux-review/ux-review-findings.md`.

### Key results

- Visual system is consistent across the unique captures: stable layout,
  typography, spacing, and color usage.
- Transcript text is readable when present, but many captured states show large
  empty areas and fail to expose the intended prompt/result content.
- Permission/question/background-task review confidence is limited because the
  artifact set is heavily duplicated: only 20 of 46 PNGs are unique by hash.
- `step-10-cancel.png` shows a dead-end lifecycle state:
  `Resume Session` + `This session is missing its machine metadata, so it cannot be resumed.`
- `step-28-stop-session-while-permission-is-pending.png` looks layout-stable,
  but the failure is under-explained and visually resembles the generic
  permission-pending state.

### Duplicate screenshot groups

- `step-01` through `step-07` are the same image.
- `step-11` through `step-15` are the same image.
- `step-17` through `step-19` are the same image.
- `step-21` through `step-23` are the same image.
- `step-29` through `step-38` mostly collapse to a single image, including the
  background-task and summary steps.

## Current Task

TASK: Phase 1.6 — Fix UX capture fidelity

Investigate why the webreel UX screenshot set contains large duplicate groups
and fix the capture flow so each labeled step saves a screenshot from the
intended UI state. Focus first on the duplicated groups identified above, then
re-run the UX capture for those steps and verify the resulting PNGs are unique
where the UI state should differ.
