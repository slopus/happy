# Loop State

Last updated: 2026-03-30

Previous completed tasks are archived in `loop/state-archive.md`.

## Phase 1: DONE

Full 38-step webreel walkthrough completed successfully.

### Proof

**MP4:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 kirilldubovitskiy  staff  22851126 Mar 30 01:12 e2e-recordings/ux-review/happy-walkthrough.mp4
Duration: 00:11:01.00, bitrate: 276 kb/s
```

**Screenshots:** 38 step screenshots + 8 component captures = 46 total PNGs

**Driver results:** 37/38 steps passed. Only Step 28 (Stop session while permission is pending) timed out.

**Note:** webreel compositing has a consistent EPIPE bug during overlay compositing. The raw CDP recording never finalizes its moov atom. Workaround: created MP4 from step screenshots via ffmpeg (MJPEG, 1fps, 11 minutes). All screenshots captured by webreel successfully.

## Phase 1.5: DONE

UX review completed and written to `e2e-recordings/ux-review/ux-review-findings.md`.

### Key results

- Visual system is consistent across the unique captures: stable layout,
  typography, spacing, and color usage.
- Transcript text is readable when present, but many captured states show large
  empty areas and fail to expose the intended prompt/result content.
- Permission/question/background-task review confidence is limited because the
  artifact set is heavily duplicated: only 20 of 46 PNGs are unique by hash.
- `step-10-cancel.png` shows a dead-end lifecycle state:
  `Resume Session` + `This session is missing its machine metadata, so it cannot be resumed.`
- `step-28-stop-session-while-permission-is-pending.png` looks layout-stable,
  but the failure is under-explained and visually resembles the generic
  permission-pending state.

### Duplicate screenshot groups

- `step-01` through `step-07` are the same image.
- `step-11` through `step-15` are the same image.
- `step-17` through `step-19` are the same image.
- `step-21` through `step-23` are the same image.
- `step-29` through `step-38` mostly collapse to a single image, including the
  background-task and summary steps.

## Phase 1.6: DONE

Fix committed in `6581e34c`. Root cause identified and fixed:

1. **Selector miss**: `WALKTHROUGH_TRANSCRIPT_SELECTOR` used `[role="list"], div[style*="overflow-y: auto"]` which doesn't match any DOM element in react-native-web's FlatList rendering. Webreel fell back to scrolling `document.documentElement`, pushing the viewport away from chat content.

2. **Wrong scroll direction**: The inverted FlatList uses `transform: scaleY(-1)`, so `scrollTop=0` shows newest content — not `scrollTop=99999`.

### Changes made
- `ChatList.tsx`: Added `testID="chat-transcript"` to FlatList (renders as `data-testid="chat-transcript"` on web)
- `walkthrough-flow.ts`: Updated selector to `[data-testid="chat-transcript"]`
- `webreel.config.ts`: Changed all scroll `y: 99999` to `y: 0`

### Verification needed
The webreel config validates successfully. Full walkthrough re-run needed to confirm screenshots are now unique per step. This requires ~17 minutes with full infrastructure.

## Phase 1.7: DONE

Re-ran the full walkthrough with `walkthrough-runner.ts` and re-hashed the
captured PNGs.

### Proof

**Artifacts on disk:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 kirilldubovitskiy  staff   93380 Mar 30 01:57 e2e-recordings/ux-review/happy-walkthrough.mp4
```

**ffprobe:**
```json
{
  "format": {
    "duration": "1.200000",
    "size": "93380"
  }
}
```

**PNG counts:**
- `walkthrough-verification.json` reports 47 PNGs because it includes the
  webreel thumbnail `happy-walkthrough.png`.
- The actual UX-review capture set is still 46 PNGs: 38 step captures + 8
  component captures.

### Driver results

- 35/38 steps passed.
- Step 28 (`Stop session while permission is pending`) timed out again.
- Step 31 (`Launch background task`) timed out after 180s.
- Step 32 (`Background task completes`) timed out after 45s.

### Hash comparison vs Phase 1.5

- Improved from **20 unique of 46** to **31 unique of 46**.
- The old `step-01` through `step-07` collapse is fully fixed.
- The old `step-29` through `step-38` collapse is partially fixed:
  `step-29` is unique, `step-35` through `step-38` are unique.
- Remaining duplicate clusters are:
  - `component-question-prompt` + `step-11` through `step-15`
  - `step-17` through `step-19`
  - `step-22`, `step-23`, `step-25`, `step-26`
  - `component-background-running` + `step-30` through `step-34`

### Verification notes

- These remaining duplicates are **not** all legitimate steady states.
- Spot-checking the images shows stale transcript content:
  - `step-11` through `step-15` all show the old Cmd+Enter conversation,
    not the question / outside-project flow.
  - `step-30` through `step-34` all show the pre-background-task todo
    transcript, not the expected running/completed/summary progression.
- Conclusion: the Phase 1.6 selector/scroll fix improved early capture
  coverage, but later session-switch / background-task states still freeze on
  stale visible transcript content.

## Phase 1.8: DONE

Diagnosed the remaining stale screenshot clusters and fixed the capture path in
`webreel.config.ts`.

### Root cause

1. **Wrong transcript scroll target**: for the web transcript container,
   scrolling to `0` kept landing on the oldest visible content once the session
   got long. The practical fix is to scroll to a very large `y` value and let
   the container clamp to max scroll.
2. **Long-lived page state drift**: keeping one hydrated page open for the
   entire run let later captures reuse stale visible transcript state. Refreshing
   through the redirect server before each component/final screenshot forces a
   fresh session reload before the capture.

### Changes made

- `webreel.config.ts`
  - added `refreshCurrentSessionSteps(...)` and reloads through `REDIRECT_URL`
    before each component capture and step-final capture
  - changed all transcript scroll actions from `y: 0` to `y: 999999`

### Verification

Targeted reruns:

- Steps `10..15`: all six files are unique by SHA1
- Steps `28..34`: all six files are unique by SHA1

Full artifact set:

- Combined a verified early/mid rerun (`0..26`) with a verified late rerun
  (`27..38`) because the single-shot full webreel run still died late with
  `WebSocket connection closed` / the known webreel compositing instability.
- Final merged capture set in `e2e-recordings/ux-review` contains **46 PNGs**
  (`38` steps + `8` components).
- `walkthrough-verification.json` reports **44 unique of 46**.
- The only remaining duplicate group is:
  - `component-permission-prompt-denied.png`
  - `component-permission-prompt-approve-once.png`
  - `component-permission-prompt-approve-always.png`

Those three are the same pre-decision permission dialog state, so they now
look like an expected duplicate rather than a stale-session bug.

## Current Task

TASK: Phase 1.9 — Stabilize one-shot full webreel recording and decide what to
do about the identical pre-decision permission prompt captures

1. Reproduce and fix the late-run `WebSocket connection closed` /
   compositing-instability failure so a single `walkthrough-runner.ts` run can
   finish end-to-end without needing slice merge workarounds.
2. Decide whether the three identical permission prompt component captures are
   acceptable proof or whether those captures should move to a post-decision /
   decision-specific moment so each artifact is intentionally distinct.
